# Package installer for C, C++, ...
⚠️ **The software is only for WINDOWS and is in English and French!** ⚠️

# Functioning
Running the software requires the pre-installation of MSYS2 64-bit (https://www.msys2.org/).

The software automatically updates packages and MSYS2 if necessary. You can then specify the name of the package you wish to install. A list of suggestions will be displayed, and you simply need to enter the index of the chosen option. The program will then display the package size and ask for your confirmation before starting the installation. The package will then be installed.

To use it you have two options :
# Firstly : Use OR Compile manually
The build requires PyInstaller to be installed! If you don't have it installed, run: `pip install pyinstaller`.

You can use or compile the software program written in Python. To do this, you'll need to download the repository and then run the [batch file](https://github.com/celestinalmeras/Package-installer-for-C-CPP-and_others/blob/481282fa6310a7a8b566b432209a0099fe14f033/build.bat) to build and clean up any leftover files. If you prefer, you can also do it manually. After building and cleaning, you can delete everything (except the executable, of course). And that's it!

# Secondly : Simply execute
This executable program is a package installer based on MSYS2 64-bit. It allows you to install packages quickly and easily.
