# Package installer for C, C++, ...
⚠️ **The software is only for WINDOWS and is in French!**
This executable program is a package installer based on MSYS2 64-bit. It allows you to install packages quickly and easily.

Running the software requires the pre-installation of MSYS2 64-bit (https://www.msys2.org/).

The software automatically updates packages and MSYS2 if necessary. You can then specify the name of the package you wish to install. A list of suggestions will be displayed, and you simply need to enter the index of the chosen option. The program will then display the package size and ask for your confirmation before starting the installation. The package will then be installed.
